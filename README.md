## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a real-time monitoring system designed to track employee behavior and detect distractions (e.g., phone usage, sleeping, or leaving the desk) using computer vision techniques. It uses the YOLO object detection model to identify actions from webcam or video input, combined with OpenCV for image processing and optionally Flask for dashboard display.
